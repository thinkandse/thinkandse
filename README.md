<h1>👋 Hi, I’m @thinkandse</h1>
<br>
I am currently learning Flask outside of school, and Unity engine at school.
<br>
<br>
I have first wrote a line of code when I was 8 in Roblox Studio which was the print("Hello, World!), I didn't really do much more computer science until I turned 13.
<br>
<br>
Writing this README was hard since I am bad at HTML, I am still learning the basics of GitHub so you can contact me via Discord "thinkandse"
